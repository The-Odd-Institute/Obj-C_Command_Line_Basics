This lesson covers OOP, variables, scopes, programming languages, syntax and logic as well as the classes and objects. 

We looked at using ObjC to organize and modularize our code. 

Classes were defined as machines where definitions for creating things (objects) are stored and can be used to produce as many of this objects as needed. 

We looked at how to create a class and instance objects from it. 

We declared and defined multiple functions and spoke of the return types and arguments of a function. 

Finally we discussed the use of built-in NSArray and NSMutableArray classes. They are used to store clusters of objects in an ordered manner.
